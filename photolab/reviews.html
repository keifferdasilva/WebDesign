        <p class='comment'>Keiffer was the best choice for my son's prom pictures. I was worried about taking them myself but it was definitely the right
        decision to have Keiffer take the pictures. Now we will always have the great memories from that day along with the amazing photos.</p>

        <p class='comment'>We hired Keiffer not really expecting too much since the price was so cheap but the photos turned out amazing.
        It was great for the relatives that weren't able to be there to feel like they were through those photos.</p>

        <p class='comment'>I've always though of myself as a pretty good photographer and wanted to take my daughter's photos myself but
        my husband felt it would be better to hire someone else. I'm glad we went with Keiffer because it was so much better than anything
        I could have done myself.</p>
